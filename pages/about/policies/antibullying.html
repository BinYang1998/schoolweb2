<h1>Mount Sion CBS Secondary School Anti-Bullying Policy</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In accordance with the requirements of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 and the code of behaviour guidelines issued by the NEWB, the Board of Management of Mount Sion CBS Secondary School has adopted the following anti-bullying policy within the framework of the school&rsquo;s overall code of behaviour. This policy fully complies with the requirements of the <em>Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools </em>which were published in September 2013.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The Board of Management recognises the very serious nature of bullying and the negative impact that it can have on the lives of pupils and is therefore fully committed to the following key principles of best practice in preventing and tackling bullying behaviour:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A positive school culture and climate which</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>is welcoming of difference and diversity and is based on inclusivity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encourages pupils to disclose and discuss incidents of bullying behaviour in a non-threatening environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promotes respectful relationships across the school community</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effective leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A school-wide approach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A shared understanding of what bullying is and its impact</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of education and prevention strategies (including awareness raising measures) that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>build empathy, respect and resilience in pupils</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>explicitly address the issues of cyber-bullying and identity-based bullying including in particular, homophobic and transphobic bullying</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effective supervision and monitoring of pupils</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supports for staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistent recording, investigation and follow up of bullying behaviour (including use of established intervention strategies)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-going evaluation of the effectiveness of the anti-bullying policy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>In accordance with the <em>Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools</em> bullying is defined as follows:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Bullying is unwanted negative behaviour, verbal, psychological or physical conducted, by an individual or group against another person (or persons) and which is repeated over time.</p>
<p>The following types of bullying behaviour are included in the definition of bullying:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>deliberate exclusion, malicious gossip and other forms of relational bullying,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cyber-bullying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identity-based bullying such as homophobic bullying, racist bullying, bullying based on a person&rsquo;s membership of the Traveller community and bullying of those with disabilities or special educational needs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Isolated or once-off incidents of intentional negative behaviour, including a once-off offensive or hurtful text message or other private messaging, do not fall within the definition of bullying and should be dealt with, as appropriate, in accordance with the school&rsquo;s code of behaviour.</p>
<p>However, in the context of this policy, placing a once-off offensive or hurtful public message, image or statement on a social network site or other public forum where that message, image or statement can be viewed and/or repeated by other people will be regarded as bullying behaviour.</p>
<p>Negative behaviour that does not meet this definition of bullying will be dealt with in accordance with the school&rsquo;s code of behaviour.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Types of bullying</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following are some of the types of bullying behaviour that can occur amongst pupils:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical aggression</strong>: This behaviour includes pushing, shoving, punching, kicking, poking and tripping people. It may also take the form of severe physical assault. While pupils often engage in &lsquo;mess fights&rsquo;, they can sometimes be used as a disguise for physical harassment or inflicting pain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intimidation: </strong>Some bullying behaviour takes the form of intimidation. It may be based on the use of very aggressive body language with the voice being used as a weapon. Particularly upsetting can be a facial expression which conveys aggression and/or dislike.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolation/exclusion and other relational bullying</strong>: This occurs where a certain person is deliberately isolated, excluded or ignored by some or all of the class group. This practice is usually initiated by the person engaged in bullying behaviour and can be difficult to detect. It may be accompanied by writing insulting remarks about the pupil in public places, by passing around notes about or drawings of the pupil or by whispering insults about them loud enough to be heard. Relational bullying occurs when a person&rsquo;s attempts to socialise and form relationships with peers are repeatedly rejected or undermined. One of the most common forms includes control: &ldquo;Do this or I won&rsquo;t be your friend anymore&rdquo;(implied or stated); a group ganging up against one person pupil; non-verbal gesturing; malicious gossip; spreading rumours about a person or giving them the &ldquo;silent treatment&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cyber-bullying: </strong>This type of bullying is increasingly common and is continuously evolving. It is bullying carried out through the use of information and communication technologies such as text, social network sites, e-mail, instant messaging (IM), apps, gaming sites, chat-rooms and other online technologies. Being the target of inappropriate or hurtful messages is the most common form of online bullying. As cyber-bullying uses technology to perpetrate bullying behaviour and does not require face to face contact, cyber-bullying can occur at any time (day or night). Many forms of bullying can be facilitated through cyber-bullying. For example, a target may be sent homophobic text messages or pictures may be posted with negative comments about a person&rsquo;s sexuality, appearance etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Name calling</strong>: Persistent name-calling directed at the same individual(s) which hurts, insults or humiliates should be regarded as a form of bullying behaviour. Often name-calling of this type refers to physical appearance, e.g., size or clothes worn. Accent or distinctive voice characteristics may attract negative attention. Academic ability can also provoke name calling. This tends to operate at two extremes. There are those who are singled out for attention because they are perceived to be weak academically. At the other extreme there are those who, because they are perceived as high achievers, are also targeted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Damage to property</strong>: Personal property can be the focus of attention for bullying behaviour. This may result in damage to clothing, mobile phone or other devices, school books and other learning material or interference with a pupil&rsquo;s locker or bicycle. The contents of school bags and pencil cases may be scattered on the floor. Items of personal property may be defaced, broken, stolen or hidden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extortion</strong>: Demands for money may be made, often accompanied by threats (sometimes carried out in the event of the targeted pupil not delivering on the demand). A pupil may also be forced into theft of property for delivery to another who is engaged in bullying behaviour<strong>.</strong></p>

</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>The relevant teachers in Mount Sion CBS for investigating and dealing with bullying are the Principal or Deputy Principal. Any teacher, SNA, or member of staff may report an incident of behaviour and the Principal or Deputy Principal will investigate same. On completion of the investigation, the Principal or Deputy Principal with reference to DES Anti-Bullying Procedures will make a determination as to whether the incident will be recorded on the Bullying Record per DES Anti-Bullying Procedures.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If circumstances warrant it any teacher may act as a relevant teacher.</p>

<li>
<p>The school&rsquo;s procedures for investigation, follow-up and recording of bullying behaviour and the established intervention strategies used by the school for dealing with cases of bullying behaviour are as follows</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Procedures for Investigating and Dealing with Bullying</strong></p>
<p>The primary aim in investigating and dealing with bullying is to resolve any issues and to restore, as far as is practicable, the relationships of the parties involved (rather than to apportion blame).</p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s procedures will be consistent with the following approach.</p>
<p>Every effort will be made to ensure that all involved (including pupils, parent(s)/guardian(s)) understand this approach from the outset.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting bullying behaviour</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Any pupil or parent(s)/guardian(s) may bring a bullying incident to any teacher in the school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All reports, including anonymous reports of bullying, will be investigated and dealt with by the Principal or Deputy Principal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaching and non-teaching staff such as secretaries, special needs assistants (SNAs), bus escorts, caretakers, cleaners must report any incidents of bullying behaviour witnessed by them, or mentioned to them, to the Principal or Deputy Principal</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investigating and dealing with reported incidents</strong>:</p>
<p>In investigating and dealing with reported incidents, the Principal or Deputy Principal will exercise his professional judgement to determine whether bullying has occurred and how best the situation might be resolved.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Where possible, incidents should be investigated outside the classroom situation to ensure the privacy of all involved. All interviews should be conducted with sensitivity and with due regard to the rights of all pupils concerned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A calm, unemotional problem-solving approach is essential</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parent(s)/guardian(s) and pupils are required to co-operate with any investigation and assist the school in resolving any issues and restoring, as far as is practicable, the relationships of the parties involved as quickly as possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pupils who are not directly involved can also provide very useful information in this way</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When analysing incidents of reported bullying behaviour, the Principal or Deputy Principal should seek answers to questions of what, where, when, who and why. This should be done in a calm manner, setting an example in dealing effectively with a conflict in a non-aggressive manner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a group is involved, each member may be interviewed individually at first. Thereafter, all those involved may be met as a group where deemed appropriate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each member of a group should be supported through the possible pressures that may face them from the other members of the group after the interview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow up meeting may be appropriate to confirm that the incident has been resolved</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Procedures for dealing with confirmed incidents of bullying</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In cases where it has been determined by the Principal or Deputy Principal that bullying behaviour has occurred, the following procedure will be followed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the parent(s)/guardian(s) of the parties involved will be contacted to inform them of the matter and explain the actions being taken (by reference to the school policy)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it will be made clear to the pupil engaged in bullying behaviour how he is in breach of the school&rsquo;s anti-bullying policy and efforts will be made to try to get him to see the situation from the perspective of the pupil being bullied</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the pupil engaged in the bullying behaviour will be given the opportunity to immediately cease the bullying behaviour and thereby avoid any school sanction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the victim will agree to inform the Principal or Deputy Principal immediately of any further bullying behaviour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the pupil engaged in the bullying behaviour and victim if agreeable will meet the Principal or Deputy Principal and in a restorative session will be made aware of the proposed way to a resolution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the event of a recurrence of the bullying behaviour the pupil engaged in the bullying behaviour will be subject to the appropriate sanctions as per the school Code of Behaviour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the school will give parent(s)/guardian(s) an opportunity of discussing ways in which they can reinforce or support the actions being taken by the school and the supports provided to the pupils</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It will also be made clear to all involved (each set of pupils and parent(s)/guardian(s)) that in any situation where disciplinary sanctions are required, this is a private matter between the pupil being disciplined, his or her parent(s)/guardian(s) and the school</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Follow up and recording</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In determining whether a bullying case has been adequately and appropriately addressed the the Principal or Deputy Principal must, as part of his professional judgement, take the following factors into account:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>whether the bullying behaviour has ceased;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether any issues between the parties have been resolved as far as is practicable;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether the relationships between the parties have been restored as far as is practicable;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any feedback received from the parties involved or their parent(s)/guardian(s)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Follow-up meetings with the relevant parties involved should be arranged separately or together if appropriate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where a parent(s)/guardian(s) is not satisfied that the school has dealt with a bullying case in accordance with these procedures, the parent(s)/guardian(s) must be referred, as appropriate, to the school&rsquo;s complaints procedures, by reference to The Board of Management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event that a parent(s)/guardian(s) has exhausted the school's complaints procedures and is still not satisfied, the school must advise the parent(s)/guardian(s) of their right to make a complaint to the Ombudsman for Pupils</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All confirmed incidents of bullying will recorded by the Principal or Deputy Principal on standard form (Mount Sion CBS Record of Bullying Behaviour) and will be retained on file</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Established intervention strategies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Teacher interviews with all pupils</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negotiating agreements between pupils and following these up by monitoring progress. This can be on an informal basis or implemented through a more structured mediation process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with parent(s)/guardian(s)s to support school interventions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No Blame Approach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other such strategic that form best practise as Anti-Bullying Interventions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behaviour Management approach via the school Code of Behaviour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthening the victim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mediation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>The school&rsquo;s programme of support for working with pupils affected by bullying is as follows</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All in-school supports and opportunities will be provided for the pupils affected by bullying to participate in activities designed to raise their self-esteem, to develop friendships and social skills and build resilience e.g.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pastoral care system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guidance &amp; Counselling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mentoring system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support and monitoring system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aistear programme</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If pupils require counselling or further supports the school will endeavour to liaise with the appropriate agencies to organise same. This may be for the pupil affected by bullying or involved in the bullying behaviour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pupils should understand that there are no innocent bystanders and that all incidents of bullying behaviour must be reported to a teacher</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>Supervision and Monitoring of Pupils</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Board of Management confirms that appropriate supervision and monitoring policies and practices are in place to both prevent and deal with bullying behaviour and to facilitate early intervention where possible. The classroom supervision system is governed by the Supervision and levels of supervision policy, to include the Substitution and Personal Day rotas. School grounds and social circulation areas draw supervision from the annual supervision/substitution scheme. Additional supervisory elements are governed as appropriate to the educational tours policy, acceptable use policy, supervised Study policy etc. The School Child Protection Policy applies in all situations relevant to pupil supervision.</p>
<p>10. <strong>Application beyond the School Campus.</strong></p>
<p>The School reserves the right to apply its bullying policy in respect of bullying that occurs at a location, activity, function, or program that is not school related if in the opinion of the Principal and/or the Board of Management the alleged bullying has created a hostile environment at school for the victim, has infringed on the rights of the victim at the school and/or has materially or substantially disrupted the education process or the orderly operation of the school.</p>
<p>11. <strong>Prevention of Harassment</strong></p>
<p>The Board of Management confirms that the school will, in accordance with its obligations under equality legislation, take all such steps that are reasonably practicable to prevent the sexual harassment of pupils or staff or the harassment of pupils or staff on any of the nine grounds specified i.e. gender including transgender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community</p>
<p>This policy has been made available to school personnel, published on the school website and provided to the Parents&rsquo; Association. A copy of this policy will be made available to the Department of Education &amp; Skills and the patron, Edmund Rice Schools Trust, if requested.</p>
<p>This policy and its implementation will be reviewed by the Board of Management once in every school year. Written notification that the review has been completed will be made available to school personnel, published on the school website and provided to the Parents&rsquo; Association. A record of the review and its outcome will be made available, if requested, to the patron and the Department.</p>
