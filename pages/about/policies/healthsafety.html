	<h1><strong><em>Mount Sion CBS Secondary School</em></strong></h1>
	<h2><strong><em>Health &amp; Safety Policy<br></em></strong><h2>
	<h3><strong><em>Statement on General Policy</em></strong></h3>
	<p>Mount Sion CBS Secondary School is managed for its trustees, Edmund Rice Schools Trust, by a Board of Management, which will be referred to hereafter as the Board.</p>
	<p>It is the policy of the Board that it will take all reasonable and practicable steps to provide healthy and safe working conditions for our employees and our school pupils and to ensure the
	health and safety of all visitors to our school.</p>
	<p>The Board recognises that while all employees are ultimately responsible for their own safety, teachers because of the &lsquo;loco parentis&rsquo; nature of their position, have an additional
	responsibility to ensure the safety of the students under their supervision.</p>
	<p>The Board has nominated the Principal of the school as its Safety Officer and has delegated to him responsibility for implementing its safety requirements, within the school, on a day to day
	basis.</p>
	<p>Provision is made within the safety structures for the nomination of a safety Representative by the staff and also for a Safety Committee (appendix 5) representing the entire school
	community.</p>
	<p>The Board undertakes to carry out a safety audit annually and to have its results made available to staff.</p>
	<p>The Safety Statement and procedures set out in the following pages are informed throughout by the Guidelines on Managing Safety and Health in Post Primary Schools.</p>
	<p>The Board wishes to make clear that in our school the safeguarding of life takes precedence over all other matters.</p>
	<p>Please read this document carefully with a view to understanding your part in its implementation in our school. The Safety Officer is available to help clarify any aspect that you may feel needs
	clarification.</p>

	<p>Fire containment measures should continue, providing that no lives are placed in hazard. Otherwise the scene is to be abandoned and left for the attention of the Fire Brigade.</p>
	<p>Each Fire Marshall will ensure that the area for which they are responsible has been evacuated and all windows and doors are closed. They will then proceed to the designated Assembly Point, they
	will count the staff and pupils at their point, and report to the Chief Fire Marshall.</p>
	<p>When the Safety/Fire Manager notifies the Fire Brigade they should also advise them of the entrance nearest the fire and then meet there with the School Floor Plan and a brief description of what
	is known about the recent status of the fire.</p>

	<p>A fire Drill involving evacuation will be held at least once each school year. The results will be logged for subsequent discussion by the Safety Committee with the purpose of continually
	improving on efficiency and effectiveness on Fire Drill Evacuation.</p>
	<p>In accordance with the Boards responsibility a safety committee as follows is established.</p>

	<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Faulty electrical equipment can be lethal. Therefore great care must be taken by all those who use such equipment within our school.</strong></p>
	<p>It is the responsibility of the Board to ensure that all equipment provided is properly insulated and earth protected against indirect contact if insulation fails.</p>
	<p>The following are basic electrical safety checks which should be carried out by employees prior to the use of equipment requiring electrical power;-</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Check sockets for damage and security of mounting on wall.</li>
		<li>Check plugs for damage. If found to be damaged, remove appliance from use and ensure that the damage is dealt with by a competent person.</li>
		<li>Check that cable clips grips cable effectively.</li>
		<li>Check that the fuse in the plug, which is the proper one for the appliance, is always replaced by one of a similar rating.</li>
		<li>Burn or heat marks indicate danger in the plug. Have such a plug replaced by a competent person.</li>
		<li>Examine the appliance cable for damage and check for signs of wear and tear on it.</li>
		<li>Cable wrapped with insulating tape is dangerous and should be replaced.</li>
		<li>Ensure that cable length is neither too short nor too long.</li>
		<li>Cable must not become a physical or electrical hazard to people or equipment.</li>
		<li>Extension leads should not be used in a coiled position, as the heat thereby generated constitutes a fire hazard.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong>All defects or damage should be repaired, by a competent person and until then the appliance should not be used. The Safety Officer should be informed immediately.</strong></p>
	<p>In the event of shock do not make contact with the injured party until the electrical power is disconnected and the situation made safe.</p>
	<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Evacuation Procedures</strong></p>
	<p>In the event of an emergency the following evacuation procedures must be followed.</p>
	<p>The staff person nearest to the cause of an emergency will immediately direct all in proximity to a safe area and if possible close door(s) to isolate area.</p>
	<p>They will then notify the Safety Officer of the nature, cause and their estimate of its severity.</p>
	<p>The Safety Officer will assess the action to be taken which will be one of the following;-</p>
	<ol>
		<li>No further movement of staff/pupils. Emergency to be handled in-house.</li>
		<li>Partial evacuation of school. Emergency to be handled in-house or by outside assistance.</li>
		<li>Total evacuation of school. Emergency to be handled in-house or by outside assistance.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Partial evacuation will be initiated by the Safety Officer, who will instruct Staff to move pupils to the designated Assembly Point.</p>
	<p>Total evacuation will be initiated by the Safety Officer ringing the Alarm Bell and broadcasting over the public address system.</p>
	<p>In the event of a power failure a hand bell will be loudly rung throughout the school by the Principal or other nominated person.</p>
	<p>All evacuation will be along the routes marked on the attached School Floor Plan, which shows the route (and alternatives) from each school location to the designated Assembly Point.</p>
	<p>On reaching the designated Assembly Point the staff member should again count the class to ensure that all have arrived safely at the Assembly Point and report the result to the Fire
	Marshall.</p>
