        <p><strong>What is LCVP?</strong></p>
        <p>The Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP) is an intervention designed to enhance the vocational dimension of the Leaving Certificate (established). The programme was introduced in 1994 in response to the challenge placed on Ireland&rsquo;s education system by a changing work and business environment. The LCVP combines the academic strengths of the Leaving Certificate (established) with a new and dynamic focus on self&ndash;directed learning, innovation and enterprise. This two-year programme is part of an expanded provision that aims to cater for the diversity of participants&rsquo; needs at senior cycle.</p>
        <p>The primary goal of the LCVP is to prepare young people for adult life by ensuring that they are educated in the broadest sense, with an ability to cope and thrive in an environment of rapid change.
